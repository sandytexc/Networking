#### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is a fundamental protocol of the Internet, enabling the transfer of data between a client and a server. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly uses HTTP. It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems
