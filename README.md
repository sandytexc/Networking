**Understanding Networking: OSI & TCP/IP Models – Layers, Functions, and Key Differences**

---

### **1\. What is Networking?**

**Networking** refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, exchange data, and communicate. It can be as simple as two computers connected in an office or as vast as the **global internet**.

#### **Types of Networks**

* **LAN (Local Area Network):** A small network within a single location (e.g., office, home, school).  
* **WAN (Wide Area Network):** A larger network that connects multiple locations (e.g., the internet).  
* **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** A network covering a city or campus.  
* **PAN (Personal Area Network):** A small network around a person (e.g., Bluetooth devices).

#### **Basic Networking Components**

* **Router:** Directs data between networks (e.g., home to the internet).  
* **Switch:** Connects multiple devices within a network and manages traffic efficiently.  
* **Modem:** Converts internet signals for use in homes and offices.  
* **Server:** Stores and manages data/services for users.

---

### **2\. What is the Internet?**

The **Internet** is a **global network of interconnected networks** that allows devices to communicate using standard protocols (e.g., TCP/IP). It enables services like web browsing, email, and video streaming.

#### **How the Internet Works**

1. **Data Transmission:** Information is broken into small packets and sent across networks.  
2. **Routing:** Routers determine the best path for data packets to travel.  
3. **Protocols:** TCP/IP ensures reliable delivery, while HTTP/HTTPS enables web access.  
4. **DNS (Domain Name System):** Converts website names (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses.

#### **Key Internet Services**

* **World Wide Web (WWW):** A system of websites accessed via browsers.  
* **Email:** Electronic communication (SMTP, IMAP, POP3).  
* **Cloud Computing:** Remote storage and computing power (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

### **What Are Protocols?**

A **protocol** is a set of **rules and standards** that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. They ensure that devices, even from different manufacturers, can communicate effectively.

---

## **Types of Protocols (Based on OSI & TCP/IP Layers)**

### **1\. Application Layer Protocols (User Interaction)**

These protocols provide services directly to users or applications.

| Protocol | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Web browsing (HyperText Transfer Protocol, secure with SSL/TLS). |
| **FTP/SFTP** | File transfer (File Transfer Protocol, Secure FTP). |
| **SMTP, POP3, IMAP** | Email communication (Send and receive emails). |
| **DNS** | Translates domain names (e.g., `google.com` → IP address). |

---

### **2\. Transport Layer Protocols (Reliable Communication)**

These protocols ensure proper data transmission between devices.

| Protocol | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** | Reliable, connection-oriented data transmission (used in web browsing, email, etc.). |
| **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** | Fast, connectionless transmission (used in video streaming, gaming, VoIP). |

---

### **3\. Internet Layer Protocols (Routing & Addressing)**

These define how data is **routed** across different networks.

| Protocol | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **IP (Internet Protocol)** | Assigns unique addresses (IPv4, IPv6) and routes packets. |
| **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** | Error reporting & network troubleshooting (e.g., `ping` command). |
| **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** | Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses. |

---

### **4\. Network Access Layer Protocols (Physical Transmission)**

These manage how data is transmitted over hardware.

| Protocol | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Ethernet** | Wired networking standard (LAN communication). |
| **Wi-Fi (802.11)** | Wireless network communication. |
| **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)** | Direct communication between two nodes (used in VPNs). |

---

### **Key Takeaways**

* **Protocols \= Communication Rules**  
* **Different layers use different protocols** (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access).  
* **Some are reliable (TCP), some are fast (UDP)**.  
* **They work together** to ensure data reaches the correct destination.

### **Addressing, CIDR Notation, IPv4, and IPv6 Explained**

---

## **1\. What is Addressing in Networking?**

Addressing in networking refers to the **assignment of unique identifiers (IP addresses)** to devices so they can communicate over a network. The two main types of addressing are **IPv4** and **IPv6**.

Each device in a network must have a **unique IP address**, similar to how a house has a unique postal address.

---

## **2\. IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4\)**

IPv4 is the **older** and most widely used version of IP addressing. It consists of **32-bit addresses**, typically written in **dotted decimal notation**.

### **IPv4 Address Format**

* IPv4 addresses are written as **four decimal numbers**, separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
* Each number (called an **octet**) ranges from **0 to 255**.

**Example:**  
 `192.168.1.1` → Binary representation: `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`

### **IPv4 Address Classes**

IPv4 is divided into **five address classes** based on the first octet:

| Class | First Octet Range | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A** | 1 \- 126 | Large networks (16M+ hosts) |
| **B** | 128 \- 191 | Medium-sized networks (65K hosts) |
| **C** | 192 \- 223 | Small networks (256 hosts) |
| **D** | 224 \- 239 | Multicasting |
| **E** | 240 \- 255 | Experimental |

### 

### **Private IPv4 Addresses (Non-Routable on Internet)**

These are used for internal networks (e.g., home or office networks):

* **Class A:** `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`  
* **Class B:** `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`  
* **Class C:** `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`

---

## **3\. IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6\)**

IPv6 is the **newer** version designed to solve IPv4 exhaustion. It uses **128-bit addresses** instead of 32-bit, allowing **trillions of unique addresses**.

### **IPv6 Address Format**

* IPv6 addresses are written in **hexadecimal** and separated by colons.  
* Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`  
* Leading **zeroes** can be omitted (`0000` → `0`).

### **Advantages of IPv6**

✔ **Larger Address Space** (Trillions of IPs)  
 ✔ **No Need for NAT (Network Address Translation)**  
 ✔ **Improved Security** (IPSec built-in)  
 ✔ **Simplified Address Configuration** (Auto-configuration with SLAAC)

### **IPv4 vs. IPv6 Comparison**

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Address Size** | 32-bit | 128-bit |
| **Format** | Dotted decimal (`192.168.1.1`) | Hexadecimal (`2001:db8::1`) |
| **Total Addresses** | \~4.3 billion | 340 undecillion (\!) |
| **Security** | Optional | Built-in (IPSec) |
| **NAT Required?** | Yes (due to limited addresses) | No |

---

## 

## **4\. CIDR Notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**

CIDR notation is a **way to represent IP addresses with their subnet masks**.

### **How CIDR Works**

* An IP address is followed by a **slash (/)** and a **number** indicating how many bits are for the network.  
* Example: `192.168.1.0/24`  
  * `/24` means the **first 24 bits** are for the **network**, and the remaining **8 bits** are for hosts.

### **Subnet Mask vs. CIDR**

| CIDR Notation | Subnet Mask | Number of Hosts |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `/8` | `255.0.0.0` | 16,777,214 |
| `/16` | `255.255.0.0` | 65,534 |
| `/24` | `255.255.255.0` | 254 |
| `/30` | `255.255.255.252` | 2 |

---

## **5\. Public vs. Private IPs**

* **Public IPs**: Routable on the internet, assigned by ISPs (e.g., `8.8.8.8` is Google’s DNS).  
* **Private IPs**: Used in LANs, **not routable** on the internet (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

---

### **Key Takeaways**

✔ **IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit.**  
 ✔ **CIDR notation simplifies subnetting (e.g., `/24` means 255.255.255.0).**  
 ✔ **Private IPs are for internal networks, while public IPs are for internet use.**  
 ✔ **IPv6 eliminates NAT, supports more devices, and improves security.**

### **1\. What is DNS (Domain Name System)?**

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is like the **"phonebook" of the internet**. It translates **human-friendly domain names** (e.g., `google.com`) into **IP addresses** (e.g., `142.250.183.206`), allowing users to access websites without remembering numerical IPs.

#### **How DNS Works**

1. **User enters a domain name** (e.g., `google.com`) in a browser.  
2. **DNS Resolver** (ISP's DNS server) looks for the corresponding IP address.  
3. **Recursive Query**: If the resolver doesn’t have the IP cached, it contacts other DNS servers.  
4. **Root DNS Server** → **TLD Server (.com, .org, etc.)** → **Authoritative DNS Server**.  
5. The **correct IP address is returned**, and the user is directed to the website.

#### **Types of DNS Servers**

* **Recursive Resolver**: Handles queries from users and finds the IP.  
* **Root DNS Server**: First step in DNS lookup (only 13 root servers worldwide).  
* **TLD (Top-Level Domain) Server**: Manages `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.  
* **Authoritative DNS Server**: Stores actual domain-to-IP mappings.

#### **Common DNS Record Types**

| Record Type | Purpose | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A Record** | Maps domain to IPv4 | `google.com → 142.250.183.206` |
| **AAAA Record** | Maps domain to IPv6 | `google.com → 2607:f8b0::200e` |
| **CNAME Record** | Alias for another domain | `www.example.com → example.com` |
| **MX Record** | Mail server for email | `mail.google.com` |
| **TXT Record** | Stores arbitrary text data (SPF, DKIM, etc.) | SPF record for email security |

#### 

#### **Public DNS Servers**

| Provider | Primary DNS | Secondary DNS |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Google** | `8.8.8.8` | `8.8.4.4` |
| **Cloudflare** | `1.1.1.1` | `1.0.0.1` |
| **OpenDNS** | `208.67.222.222` | `208.67.220.220` |

---

### **2\. What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?**

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a **network protocol** that **automatically assigns IP addresses** and other configuration settings to devices on a network.

#### **How DHCP Works**

1. **Device (Client) connects** to a network.  
2. **DHCP Discover**: The client sends a broadcast request for an IP.  
3. **DHCP Offer**: The server responds with an available IP address.  
4. **DHCP Request**: The client requests the offered IP.  
5. **DHCP Acknowledgment**: The server confirms and assigns the IP.

#### **What Does DHCP Assign?**

* **IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)  
* **Subnet Mask** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)  
* **Default Gateway** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)  
* **DNS Servers** (e.g., `8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`)  
* **Lease Time** (How long the IP is valid)

####

---

### **Summary**

✔ **DNS** translates domain names into IP addresses for internet access.  
 ✔ **DHCP** dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network.  
 ✔ **DNS helps you find websites**, while **DHCP helps devices connect to a network**.

### **Client and Server, Data Center Explained**

---

## **1\. Client and Server**

A **Client-Server model** is a fundamental concept in networking where **clients request services**, and **servers provide them**.

### **Client**

A **client** is a device or software that **requests services** from a server.

* Can be a **computer, smartphone, or application** (e.g., web browsers, email clients).  
* Example: When you visit `google.com`, your browser (client) sends a request to Google’s servers.

### **Server**

A **server** is a powerful system that **provides resources, services, or data** to clients.

* Can be **physical (hardware) or virtual (cloud-based)**.  
* Example: A **web server** hosts websites, and a **mail server** manages emails.

### **Client-Server Communication Example**

1. You type `www.google.com` in a browser (Client).  
2. Your computer sends a request to Google’s **DNS Server**.  
3. The **Web Server** processes the request and responds with the webpage.  
4. Your browser displays the page.

### **Types of Servers**

| Server Type | Purpose | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Web Server** | Hosts websites & web apps | Apache, Nginx, IIS |
| **Database Server** | Stores and manages databases | MySQL, PostgreSQL |
| **File Server** | Stores and manages files | Google Drive, OneDrive |
| **Mail Server** | Handles email sending/receiving | Microsoft Exchange, Gmail |

![][image2]

Here’s a diagram illustrating the **Client-Server model** and **Data Center** concepts. 

---

**Summary**

✔ **Client-Server model** allows efficient resource sharing.  
 ✔ **Clients request services, servers respond** (e.g., web browsing, emails).  
 ✔ **Data Centers power the internet**, hosting websites, applications, and cloud services.

### **What are Ports?**

Ports are logical endpoints for communication in computer networks. They are used by network protocols (like TCP or UDP) to identify specific processes or services running on a server or device. Each port is associated with a number, ranging from 0 to 65535\. These numbers are divided into categories:

1. **Well-known ports (0-1023):** Reserved for common services, such as:  
   * **Port 80:** HTTP (web traffic)  
   * **Port 443:** HTTPS (secure web traffic)  
   * **Port 22:** SSH (secure shell)  
   * **Port 25:** SMTP (email sending)  
2. **Registered ports (1024-49151):** Used by applications that are not as widely standardized but still need to avoid conflicts.

3. **Dynamic or private ports (49152-65535):** Often used for ephemeral connections, where the client needs to open a port for temporary communication.

Each port enables a service (e.g., web server, database) on the host machine to distinguish between different types of network traffic and handle requests appropriately.

---

**What is a Load Balancer?**

A **load balancer** is a device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed with too many requests. The goal is to maximize throughput, minimize response time, and prevent any server from being a bottleneck.

Key functions of a load balancer:

1. **Traffic Distribution:** It evenly distributes incoming requests across servers in a pool, based on specific algorithms like Round Robin, Least Connections, or IP Hashing.  
2. **Fault Tolerance:** If one server fails, the load balancer can reroute traffic to healthy servers, ensuring high availability.  
3. **Scalability:** As demand increases, you can add more servers behind the load balancer to handle the extra load without affecting performance.  
4. **Session Persistence:** Ensures that once a client is connected to a server, subsequent requests from the same client are routed to the same server (useful for applications that rely on session state).

Types of Load Balancers:

* **Hardware Load Balancers:** Physical devices used to manage traffic.  
* **Software Load Balancers:** Programs or cloud-based services that perform load balancing.

In cloud environments (like AWS, Azure), load balancing is typically provided as a managed service, and it’s essential for ensuring scalability and availability of web applications.

### **Security Groups: Rules & Their Role in Securing Cloud Instances**

#### **1\. What are Security Groups?**

A **Security Group (SG)** is a **virtual firewall** that controls **inbound and outbound traffic** for cloud instances (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs). It acts as a **layer of protection** to restrict unauthorized access.

---

### **2\. How Security Groups Work**

* **Attached to cloud instances** to control traffic.  
* **Operates at the instance level** (not the network level).  
* **Stateful**: If an inbound request is allowed, the response is automatically allowed.  
* **Rules define what traffic is permitted or denied** based on IPs, ports, and protocols.

---

### **3\. Security Group Rules**

Security groups have two types of rules:

1. **Inbound Rules** → Define what traffic **can enter** the instance.  
2. **Outbound Rules** → Define what traffic **can leave** the instance.

#### **Inbound Rule Example (Allow SSH & HTTP)**

| Rule | Protocol | Port Range | Source |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Allow SSH | TCP | 22 | Your IP (`192.168.1.1/32`) |
| Allow HTTP | TCP | 80 | `0.0.0.0/0` (All IPs) |

#### 

#### 

#### 

#### 

#### **Outbound Rule Example (Allow All Traffic)** 

| Rule | Protocol | Port Range | Destination |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Allow All** | **All** | **All** | **`0.0.0.0/0`** |

####   📌 **Best Practice:** Restrict inbound rules to trusted IPs and allow outbound traffic only when necessary.

### **4\. Significance of Security Groups in Cloud Security**

✔ **Protects Instances** → Blocks unauthorized access.  
 ✔ **Minimizes Attack Surface** → Only necessary ports are open.  
 ✔ **Easier Management** → Rules can be applied to multiple instances.  
 ✔ **Default Deny Rule** → Everything is blocked unless explicitly allowed.

### **5\. Security Group Best Practices**

✅ **Least Privilege Access** → Open only required ports (e.g., SSH to your IP only).  
 ✅ **Avoid `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH/RDP** → Use **specific IP ranges** to prevent unauthorized access.  
 ✅ **Use Separate Security Groups** → Different workloads (e.g., Web, DB) should have **different rules**.  
 ✅ **Monitor & Audit Rules Regularly** → Remove unused rules to **enhance security**.

### **Key Takeaways**

🔹 **Security Groups** act as firewalls for cloud instances.  
 🔹 They define **inbound & outbound** traffic rules.  
 🔹 **Stateful nature** ensures response traffic is automatically allowed.  
 🔹 **Follow best practices** to secure your cloud infrastructure.

# **How to Create and Configure Security Groups in the Cloud**

Security Groups (SGs) act as virtual firewalls for cloud instances, allowing or restricting traffic based on defined rules.

2. Click **Add Rule** and configure:  
   * **Type**: Select the service (e.g., SSH, HTTP, RDP, Custom TCP).  
   * **Protocol**: Automatically filled based on the type.  
   * **Port Range**: Specify the port (e.g., `22` for SSH, `80` for HTTP).  
   * **Source**: Choose **My IP** (for personal access) or **0.0.0.0/0** (to allow from anywhere \- not recommended).

### **Step 4: Configure Outbound Rules**

1. Click on the **Outbound Rules** tab.  
2. AWS allows all outbound traffic by default, but you can restrict it if needed.  
3. Click **Add Rule** to modify or restrict outbound traffic.

### **Step 5: Review and Create**

1. Review all settings.  
2. Click **Create Security Group**.

### **Step 6: Attach the Security Group to an EC2 Instance**

1. Open the **EC2 Instances** page.  
2. Select an existing instance.  
3. Click **Actions \> Networking \> Change Security Groups**.  
4. Select the newly created Security Group and apply changes.

## **2\. Creating a Security Group in Azure (Network Security Group \- NSG)**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Azure Portal**

1. Log in to the **Azure Portal**.  
2. In the search bar, type **Network Security Groups** and select it.

### **Step 2: Create a New NSG**

1. Click **Create**.  
2. Select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group**.  
3. Enter a **Name** for the NSG.  
4. Choose a **Region** (must match your Virtual Network region).  
5. Click **Review \+ Create**, then **Create**.

### **Step 3: Configure Inbound Security Rules**

1. Open the newly created NSG.  
2. Click on **Inbound Security Rules**.  
3. Click **Add Rule** and configure:  
   * **Source**: Any, IP Address, or Service Tag.  
   * **Source Port Ranges**: Enter the allowed ports.  
   * **Destination**: Any or specific Virtual Network.  
   * **Destination Port Range**: E.g., `22` for SSH, `3389` for RDP.  
   * **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, or Any.  
   * **Action**: Allow or Deny.  
   * **Priority**: Lower values have higher priority.

### **Step 4: Configure Outbound Security Rules**

1. Click on **Outbound Security Rules**.  
2. Follow similar steps as inbound rules to define outbound traffic policies.

### **Step 5: Associate NSG with a Virtual Machine**

1. Open your Virtual Machine (VM) instance.  
2. Go to **Networking**.  
3. Click **Attach Network Security Group**.  
4. Select the created NSG and save.

**Purpose and usage of Networking command**

---

### **1\. `ping`**

**Purpose:** Check connectivity to a remote host, measure round-trip time.  
 **Usage:**

ping \<hostname\_or\_IP\>

Example:

ping google.com

**Explanation:** Sends ICMP echo requests and waits for a response, showing the time it takes for packets to reach the destination.

---

### **2\. `traceroute` / `tracert`**

**Purpose:** Trace the path packets take to a destination, showing each hop along the route.  
 **Usage:**

* On Linux/macOS:

traceroute \<hostname\_or\_IP\>

* On Windows:

tracert \<hostname\_or\_IP\>

Example:

tracert google.com

**Explanation:** Shows each intermediate router (hop) and the time it takes for packets to travel from your machine to the destination.

---

### **3\. `netstat`**

**Purpose:** Display network connections, routing tables, and network statistics.  
 **Usage:**

netstat

Example:

netstat \-an

**Explanation:** Shows a list of all active connections and listening ports. You can use flags like `-a` for all connections, `-n` for numeric output.

---

### **4\. `curl`**

**Purpose:** Make HTTP requests to interact with web servers or APIs.  
 **Usage:**

curl \<URL\>

# Networking
#### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is a fundamental protocol of the Internet, enabling the transfer of data between a client and a server. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly uses HTTP. It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems
